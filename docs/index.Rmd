## Covid Report

From the COVID-19 analysis, we got a total of cases and deaths in the United States. The total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. The number of deaths that occurred in the US from COVID-19 is `r get_total_deaths()`.

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
